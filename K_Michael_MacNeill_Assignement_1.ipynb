My Draft Code did not have an errors this time however, ChatGPT (level 4) changed where I built \"cleaned\" one character at a time (cleaned += c.lower()), then compared cleaned == cleaned[::-1]. Which works but it's slower because string creates a new string every time so it changed the code to use the \"two-pointer approach\" that scans from both ends, skips non-alphanumeric in place, and compares lowercase characters directly. This avoids creating a second string and keeps extra space O(1) while staying O(n) time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. In my Draft Code I filtered everything out first, then compared the entire cleaned string to the reverse. There’s AI explained that there's no early stop so we always build the entire cleaned string. It changed this by adding individual skip loops for non-alphanumeric characters on both left and right, and returns false immediately on the first time they don't match. It also explained that this is faster for longer inputs and stops and loops back as soon as we know it isn’t a palindrome.\n"

        "When using ChatGPT (Level 4) to improve my Draft Code for this problem, it helped me better use the peer-reviewed approach I looked at to build a new string with only lowercase letters and numbers, then compare it to the reverse. My attempt at this in my Draft Code worked without any errors however, AI explained it wasn’t very efficient because it required creating a new string in the memory everytime.\n",

        "ChatGPT (level 4) suggested an alternative called the two-pointer method. This is where you skip non-alphanumeric characters in place and compare characters from both ends without building a new string. This reduced the space usage and also allowed the function to stop early if there was no Palindrome instead of running the entire string.\n",

        "My contributions without AI were breaking down the step by step process after level 1 AI helped me understand the concept of the problem, and writing the Draft Code myself based on the peer reviewed solution. I was also able to understand how .isalnum() and .lower() work in Python to clean up the string, and I manually checked the examples like, \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\", \"race a car\", and \" \", to verify the logic of my draft and the final AI assisted corrected code gave the proper results."

        "I have a basic understanding of Python however this was a very challenging assignment for me to be honest. It was very fun though learning how to breakdown these problems while also learning how useful of a tool AI can be without just copy-pasting the answers which made this a very doable assignment for me, without it I would've been stuck and had to work a lot slower. I also see how as we went over in the lectures that as a coder you can still develop the critial thinking and problem solving abilities using AI as a tool to do all the \"boring stuff\" and help me understand the concepts much more efficiently. Looking forward to more of these CT and problem-solving activies!\n",
